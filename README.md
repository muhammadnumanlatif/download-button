# Download Button

Apps are filled with buttons that execute long-running behaviors. For example, a button might trigger a download, which starts a download process, receives data over time, and then provides access to the downloaded asset. It’s helpful to show the user the progress of a long-running process, and the button itself is a good place to provide this feedback. In this recipe, you’ll build a download button that transitions through multiple visual states, based on the status of an app download.
